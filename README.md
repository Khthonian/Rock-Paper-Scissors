# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## How Does It Operate?
A rudimentary implementation of JavaScript to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Originally designed to operate within the console, now operates fully within the webpage. 

## Rules
Rounds are played between the player and the CPU until a player reaches a score of 5. A win is worth 1 point, and a draw is worth half a point. A loss yields no points at all.
